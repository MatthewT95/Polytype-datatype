# Polytype - Datatype

This repo provides a class Variable, which can store several different datatypes. Each instance can dynamically change its type and value at run time. It can also be locked to a specific type(Static type) or value(Constant). Some datatypes are collections which can store multiple Variable instances inside them. Collections can even store other collections. A collections elements can be locked to specific type as well. Single value types include Integer,Float,String and Boolean. Collection types include List,Dictionary,Stack and Queue. There are also special types such None,Any and Error. Finally, there is a Pointer datatype which stores a reference to another Variable instance. Some datatypes values such Integer,Float,String and Boolean can be casted to other types.
